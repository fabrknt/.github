# We are Fabriquant 👋

Fabriquant is a unified precision execution stack for Solana, built with the vision of mastering parallel execution for the next generation of autonomous finance. By leveraging Solana’s Sealevel runtime, Fabriquant provides the high-performance "looms" and safety frameworks necessary for AI Agents and DeFi protocols to weave complex transactions with absolute precision and zero conflict.

### 🧵 Weaving the Transaction Layer
In a parallel execution environment, transactions are no longer linear—they are a complex fabric. Fabriquant has designed practical, modular solutions to manage this complexity:

* **Loom (`solfabric`):** An advanced framework for structured state management and parallel optimization.
* **Guard (`sol-ops-guard`):** An on-chain safety layer providing execution constraints and anti-drain logic for autonomous operations.
* **Risk (`pulsar`):** An AI-driven risk assessment gateway for RWA validation and asset integrity.
* **Privacy (`arbor`):** A scaling and confidentiality layer utilizing ZK Compression for cost-efficient, shielded execution.

### 🛡️ Our Mission
Fabriquant’s mission is to build a secure, transparent, and high-velocity execution infrastructure that empowers developers to build sophisticated AI-driven financial agents while ensuring institutional-grade safety. We are committed to optimizing compute efficiency and maximizing throughput across the Solana ecosystem.
