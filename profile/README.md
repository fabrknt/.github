# fabrknt

**Crypto-financial execution infrastructure**  
for builders shipping real financial products.

fabrknt is a crypto-native execution stack designed to help teams  
build **production-ready financial applications** on Solana and EVM  
— without rebuilding the hardest parts of crypto-finance.

## What is fabrknt?

Building crypto-financial products still takes months because every team:

- designs transaction flows from scratch  
- reimplements wallet and key management  
- invents custom ledger and accounting logic  
- handles failures and retries manually  

fabrknt abstracts this complexity into  
**opinionated, production-ready primitives**.

You focus on business logic.  
fabrknt handles execution, reliability, and financial plumbing.

## Built with cross-border finance in mind

Designed from Singapore,  
informed by real-world experience across:

- Hong Kong  
- India  

Different regulators.  
Different banking systems.  
Different risk models.

That reality is reflected in the architecture.
